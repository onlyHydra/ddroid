# App was developed using Intellij and Java.
It's a console app. 
I'll be describing the following commands and their use case:

1: "stop" it will stop the main programLoop and as such it will close the app

syntax : stop

2: "Select" . this command was made for selecting products from a catalog. It will automatically display the catalog aswell.

syntax : Select

console will output the following :

Mouse - $10.99

Keyboard - $40.99

Monitor - $164.99

Webcam - $84.99

Headphones - $59.99

DeskLamp - $89.99

Now the console app will wait for the end-user to inpute the name of a product and the cantity he desires to buy.

syntax : Product_name quantity , the syntax is Capslock sensitive 
example : Mouse 1 , it will work
example : mouse 1, it wont work ( it will not crash it wont add the item in the shopping cart)

After the end-user has completed all the purcheses , he needs to type 0 in console 


3:"Checkout" , generates the invoice 

4:"Command" , i made it avaible only during the Select proccess. For example:
user_input >> Select
User has forgot how the command works ,
user_input >> Command

it will display all the commands avaible and hits on how to use them.
